Christmas is the best holliday in the summer especialy once the leafes have falled and the turtles decided to visit the caribian islends where the little baby umbrella were as big as the bees atacking the human kind in europe were the flowers are still blooming and the war is gleaming over the graves of the poor puppets in the puppet graveyard
